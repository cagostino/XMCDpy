# XMCDpy
This program was designed to extract information from images taken using X-ray microscopy.
It was originally developed to analyze X-ray magnetic circcular dichorism (XMCD) curves.
It has since been expanded to look at absorption/transmission.
The development of the GUI was done primarily by MacCallum Robertson.
